### Learning Algorithm
To resolve the challenge, has been used the algorithm **Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient**. This method implement DDPG to be used for multiple agents at the same time, recording all their experiences in the replay buffer:

The **deep neural networks** (actor and critic) use two hidden layers (128 units and 128 units) accompanied with batch normalization and dropout. 


The **parameters** below have had the most successful results for this algorithm:

```python
BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e5)  # replay buffer size
BATCH_SIZE = 128        # minibatch size
GAMMA = 0.99            # discount factor
TAU = 1e-3              # for soft update of target parameters
LR_ACTOR = 2e-3         # learning rate of the actor 
LR_CRITIC = 2e-3        # learning rate of the critic
WEIGHT_DECAY = 0        # L2 weight decay

ACTOR_UNITS_l1 = 128    # DNN layers units
ACTOR_UNITS_l2 = 128
CRITIC_UNITS_l1 = 128
CRITIC_UNITS_l2 = 128

GAMES = 300
MAX_T = 1000
```


### Results

The agent has solved the problem after 400 games, improving the score during 130 games:

```

### Ideas for Future Work

- Try to implement different algorithms to compare results. (PPO, A3C)
- Experiment with 'All time high' checkpoints to resume avoiding exaggerated dropping.
- Increase number of agents.
